        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <div class="steps">
          <ul>
                  
                <li>Put the water, flour, and yeast into the breadmaker.
                  
                <li>Beat the mahlab, sugar, mastic, cardamom, and a pinch of salt in a food processor, until all of the aromatics are finely ground.
                  
                <li>Add the aromatic mixture, orange zest, egg, vanilla, butter, and honey into the breadmaker.
                  
                <li>Leave in the breadmaker for about 20 minutes of kneading let the dough rise for about 2 hours.
                  
                <li>Preheat oven to 200° C.
                  
                <li>When the dough is ready, put it on a clean working surface.
                  
                <li>Roll the dough in to a baguette shape, fold in half and roll again.
                  
                <li>If the dough is more elastic than usual, add 2-3 tablespoons of flour until it thickens.
                  
                <li>Repeat this process 5-8 times, then cut in to 4 equal sized pieces.
                  
                <li>Shape each piece in to a long strip and place them one next to the other on your working surface, leaving a little space between them.
                  
                <li>Shape the 4 strips into two beautiful braids.
                  
                <li>Transfer to a baking pan lined with parchment paper.
                  
                <li>Brush with some egg whites, sprinkle with almond slivers and set it aside for 20 minutes, so it can rest and rise again.
                  
                <li>When ready, bake for 20-30 minutes, until golden.
